* Integration tests for the compiler
* Implement module overrides
* Implement PreProcessedModuleProcessor that a) provides a plugin ctor and b) fixes up any Container.CreateWithPlugins calls.
* Throw friendlier errors when injections or binding resolves fail.
* Switch keys to be based on assembly-qualified names (TypeReference -> Assembly.CreateQualifiedName(tr.Module.Assembly.FullName, tr.FullName))
* Create compiled inject bindings inside of injectable classes and relax the public ctor/setter requirements - require only protected.
